{#
    This macro creates an effectivity satellite version 0 for a link entity, based on the stage data. It can handle multiple loads and
    is therefor ready for both initial loads on persistent staging areas, and incremental loads on transient staging areas.
    This version is the 0 version, because it does not include virtualized effectivity time ranges. For that you should create
    one version 1 effectivity satellite for each version 0 effectivity satellite using the eff_sat_link_v1 macro.
    
    Parameters:
    
    link_hashkey::string                        Name of the hashkey column inside the stage, that represents the primary key of the link.

                                                Examples: 
                                                    'hk_account_contact_l'  This hashkey belongs to the link between account and contact and
                                                                            was calculated before in the staging area by the stage macro.
    
    driving_key::string                         Name of the driving key column inside staging model. Based on this column one active row
                                                per ldts is set.

                                                Examples: 
                                                    'hk_account_h'          With this configuration, inside the link an account is always only
                                                                            connected to one contact at a time.

    secondary_fks::string | list of strings     Name(s) of all other foreign keys inside the link, called secondary foreign keys. A link Â´
                                                that connects two hubs usually has one driving key and one secondary foreign key. All foreign keys
                                                inside a link are either the driving key, or a secondary foreign key.

                                                Examples:
                                                    'hk_contact_h'                          Contact is the secondary foreign key in the link. That indicates
                                                                                            that multiple accounts could be connected to the same contacts.

                                                    ['hk_contact_h', 'hk_opportunity_h']    The link now connects three objects, out of them contact and
                                                                                            opporunity are the secondary foreign objects.
    
    source_model::string                        Name of the source model that is available inside dbt. Usually this would be a staging model
                                                that was created via the stage macro.

                                                Examples:
                                                    'stage_account'         The effectivity satellite is based on the staging model for account.

    src_ldts::string                            Name of the ldts column inside the source models. Is optional, will use the global variable 'dbtvault_scalefree.ldts_alias'.
                                                Needs to use the same column name as defined as alias inside the staging model.

    src_rsrc::string                            Name of the rsrc column inside the source models. Is optional, will use the global variable 'dbtvault_scalefree.rsrc_alias'.
                                                Needs to use the same column name as defined as alias inside the staging model.
